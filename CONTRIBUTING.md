## Updating the version

To bump the version of this repository, first make sure everything works and check for lint errors using `yarn lint`. Then, run `yarn version` to bump the version of the package (please follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)). This will update the version in `package.json` and create a new commit tagged with the version number. After building the project with `yarn build`, release the new package with `npm publish`. Then, push the commit and tag with `git push` and `git push --tags`. Finally, create a new release on GitHub with a changelog. To deploy the demo, run `yarn deploy`.
